## The Challenge
The task at hand was to develop a RESTful API capable of managing users, thoughts, and reactions data models for a social media startup, leveraging a NoSQL database. Crucially, the API needed to be built using Node.js and Mongoose and feature endpoints capable of handling substantial volumes of unstructured data.

## Usage Information

- Repository: After cloning the documentation, run npm i and update the .env file.
- Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project's root directory and define the necessary variables.
- Testing the API: Once the server is running, utilize tools like Insomnia to test the API endpoints.
- Available Endpoints: Each endpoint should include the requisite data in the request body or URL parameters, as outlined in the acceptance criteria.

## Installation Process
- Clone the repository from GitHub or download the ZIP folder.
- Open the cloned or downloaded repository in any source code editor.
